<h1>Insertion Sort</h1>
<p>Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<h3>First Pass:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>12, 11, 13, 5, 6</li>
    <li>11, 12, 13, 5, 6</li>
</ul>
<h3>Second Pass:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>11, 12, 13, 5, 6</li>
    <li>11, 12, 13, 5, 6</li>
</ul>
<h3>Third Pass:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>11, 12, 13, 5, 6</li>
    <li>5, 11, 12, 13, 6</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fourth Pass:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>5, 11, 12, 13, 6</li>
    <li>5, 6, 11, 12, 13</li>
</ul>
<p>The time complexity of insertion sort is O(n^2) as there are two nested loops.</p>
<p>The space complexity of insertion sort is O(1).</p>
<p>The main advantage of insertion sort is the simplicity of the algorithm.</p>
<p>The main disadvantage of insertion sort is its time complexity. It is not suitable for large datasets.</p>
<h2>Java Code:</h2>

public class InsertionSort {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {12, 11, 13, 5, 6};
        insertionSort(arr);
        System.out.println("Sorted array");
        printArray(arr);
    }

    static void insertionSort(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            int key = arr[i];
            int j = i - 1;

            /* Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are greater than key, to one position ahead of their current position */
            while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {
                arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
                j = j - 1;
            }
            arr[j + 1] = key;
        }
    }

    static void printArray(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
        System.out.println();
    }
